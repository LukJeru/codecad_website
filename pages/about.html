<h1>About</h1>
<h2>My name is Lukas Jerusalem. I'm a Web Developer and Computer Science Student.</h2>
<section>
  <p>I am currently studying for a bachelor's degree in computer science at the
    University of Hagen, but have already gained some experience in web development.</p>
  <p>My interest in web development was sparked by a bootcamp at Le Wagon. This is where I learned full-stack web development.
    I enjoyed it so much that I then decided to take up a distance learning course at the University of Hagen.</p>
  <p>During my studies, I taught children programming for a long time. Mainly as an online tutor, but also at the
    Goethe Institute in Morocco. I am currently continuing this work as a volunteer in an association in Berlin.</p>
  <p>For the most part, this is and was about simple programming with Scratch and learning solution strategies with the help of robots,
    but also about the independent development of programs and apps in Python or Javascript.</p>
